\begin{edXproblem}{Matrix expression equality}

This problem demonstrates testing of matrix expression equality.  It properly handles the non-commutativity of matrices.

Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the usual Pauli matrices,
\bea
     	X &=& \mattwoc{0}{1}{1}{0}
\\ 	Y &=& \mattwoc{0}{-i}{i}{0}
\\ 	Z &=& \mattwoc{1}{0}{0}{-1}
\,.
\eea
Give an expression $M$ equal to $iZ$.

Valid answers include {\tt X*Y} and {\tt -i*Z}.  But {\tt Y*X} is properly graded as being invalid.

\begin{edXproblem}{Quantum mechanics ket input}{attempts=1000 weight=10}

Quantum mechanics uses ``ket'' notation like $|\psi\>$ to indicate unit
vectors.

This problem demonstrates how to use customresponse python code to
check for equality of formulas with such ket notation, as well as a
javascript pre-processor to properly format ket expressions.

Type in {\tt (2*|0>+3*|b>)/sqrt(13)} as the answer below.

Multiple correct answer are supported.  {\tt |b>} is also correct, in
this example.

 }%

\begin{edXsolution}

The $\hat{n}$ vector goes through the point $(\theta, \phi)$ specified
in polar coordinates, with $\phi=0$ and 
\bea
   \theta = \cos^{-1} \frac{\omega_0/2}{\sqrt{V^2 + \left(\frac{\omega_0}{2}\right)^2}} 
   = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2V}{\omega_0}\right)
\,.
\eea
In terms $\theta$, the eigenstates may be expressed as
\bea
	|\lambda_+\> = \cos\frac{\theta}{2} |a\> +\sin\frac{\theta}{2} |b\>
\\
	|\lambda_-\> = -\sin\frac{\theta}{2} |a\> +\cos\frac{\theta}{2} |b\>

\begin{edXproblem}{Magnitude off hint}{attempts=500}

\begin{edXscript}
ans0 = 177
expected=[ ans0 ]
\end{edXscript}

\edXincludepy{XML/magnitude_hint2.py}

This problem demonstrates the ability to give hints when students
enter numerical answers which are too far from the expected result.

The correct answer is 177.  Try typing in 1 instead (you'll get a hint).

How does the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density}{energy
  density} of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum}{crude oil}
$E_{\rm oil}$ compare with the energy density of hot
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy}{geothermal}
fluid $E_{\rm geo}$?

Model the geothermal fluid as water, and assume its starts at 360 K
when pumped from oil/geothermal wells at a rate of 30 l/s, and is
cooled to 300 K.

Give the ratio of energy densities.

\edXinline{$E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo}$ =} \edXabox{expect="\$ans0" type="numerical"
  tolerance='20\%' inline='1' hintfn="hint_mag0" } 
 
\begin{edXsolution}

  If the geothermal fluid is basically just water, then its density at
  360~K is approximately 1~g/cm$^3$ (really is 0.97~g/cm$^3$ but also
  changes with temperature as heat is extracted). The heat capacity is
  approximately $c = 4.18~kJ/kg K$. If the fluid is cooled to a
  typical temperature of 300~K, then the total energy density of the
  geothermal fluid is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{\rm geo} = \rm(4.18~kJ/kg~K)(60~K) = 251~kJ/kg
\end{equation}
Oil has an energy density of around 43~MJ/kg (wikipedia gives 46
MJ/kg).  Thus, $E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo} \approx 177$, so oil has
nearly 200 times the energy density of the geothermal fluid.

Use your knowledge of the size of the Lamb shift, and the scale of fine
structure splittings, to properly label the following energy level diagram.

\begin{edXsolution}

\begin{itemize}

\item The fine structure splitting raises the four $2P_{3/2}$ states about
10 GHz above the two $2P_{1/2}$ and two $2S_{1/2}$ states.

\item The Lamb shift raises $2S_{1/2}$ above $2P_{1/2}$ by 1.06 GHz.

\begin{edXproblem}{Graphical input via jsxgraph}{attempts=1000}

The \href{http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/devdata/en/latest/course_data_formats/jsinput.html}{jsinput} framework provides a very convenient way to
employ virtually arbitrary javascript code as a user interface for
input into edX auto-graded problems.  

This is an example which uses sliders and graphs from
\href{http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/}{jsxgraph}, a nice javascript
math function plotting package, as input to a physics problem.

     Identify one such field-independent transition in the figure
     below, by doing the following:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Use the slider to select a value of $x$
     \item Choose two different states (A...H) for the transition
     \item Click ``Check'' to check your answer
     \end{itemize}
