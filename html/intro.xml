Welcome to the <tt class="tt">latex2edx</tt> demo course! </p>
  <p>
This course provides examples of some of the capabilities of the latex2edx system, which compiles [mathjaxinline]\LaTeX[/mathjaxinline] into XML code for edX courses. </p>
  <p>
The focus of this system is on providing sophisticated auto-gradable science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) problems, by extending a document preparation system to provide interactive &#x201C;answer boxes" for student input and auto-grader responses. </p>
